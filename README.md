# CS-255-Systems-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

```The DriverPass project is a web-based system for a driving school that is trying to bring a platform to the students and instructors to help them track schedules and grades, as well as allow admin and IT users the ability to modify accounts and retrieve student data.```
    
What did you do particularly well?

```I feel as if I performed the analysis on the functional requirements quite well. It seemed to be easy for me to understand, and I feel I got all of the relevant requirements set out for the system.```
    
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

```I would likely revise the constraints a bit to make it more indepth and add some constraints that I may have overlooked in the initial set up of the requirements document.```
    
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

```I looked through the interview with the client and made sure that I included all aspects that they spoke of and said they wanted included in their system. I made sure to pay close attention to what they emphasized on what was most important to them. It is important to consider user needs when designing a system to make sure that the system being built will not only be useful to the client, but also that the system operates in a way that the client can understand and the client should be able to perform any functions that are relevant to their jobs with the system.```
    
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

```I would make use of the many already developed strategies that are common in the system design process. Using requirements gathering tactics, such as Joint Application Development (JAD) or group interviews, to gather the needed requirements for analysis would ensure that I have all of the appropriate requirements to start analyzing and getting a plan in place to develop and design the system. When designing and developing the system, an agile approach is most commonly the best option to ensure that there is enough flexibility in the development process to adapt to any changes that the client may have throughout the development process. Using tools such as Data flow Diagrams and UML diagrams will help with the design of the system to be clear and easily understood for both developers and the client.```
